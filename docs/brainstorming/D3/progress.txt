## Session 79: 2025-12-12 - D3-Q21 DECIDED (Gap Resolution Started)

[2025-12-12] D3-Q21 DECIDED: Option C+E (Synthesized) - Hybrid Track Selection with Path Foundation
- Consensus: 3/3 UNANIMOUS for Hybrid pattern
  - Tech-Lead: 9/10 for Option F (BMAD-Style Educational Hybrid)
  - Research: 9/10 for Option C (Hybrid Detection)
  - Coder: 9/10 for Option E+A (Path-Based + Manual)
- Rationale: BMAD EVOLVED from L0-L4 (legacy) to 3-Track system. Pattern: Analyze description → Present tracks educationally → Recommend → USER CHOOSES → Load path file
- Critical Discovery: BMAD L0-L4 is LEGACY, production uses 3-Track system (Quick Flow, BMad Method, Enterprise Method)
- Industry Validation: 7/7 systems use explicit user choice (LangGraph, CrewAI, Temporal, Prefect, GitHub Actions, Airflow, Dagster)
- Option B (Auto-Detection) REJECTED: Rated 3/10 by all specialists - industry anti-pattern
- Binding constraints satisfied: D3-Q7 (tier activation), D3-Q15 (defaults + scoping)
- Implementation: ~180-250 LOC net new, 85-90% BMAD reuse, $4K-6K 3-year TCO
- 5-STEP PATTERN COMPLETED:
  1. EXPLORE_DEEP_DIVE - Parallel Explore agents (BMAD scale-adaptive, claude-mpm, industry)
  2. REPORT_FINDINGS - BMAD 3-Track system, claude-mpm has NO complexity, 7/7 industry explicit
  3. ULTRATHINK_SYNTHESIS - 3 specialists via /ultrathink:ultrathink
  4. RECOMMENDATION - BMad Master with GPS Analogy
  5. PRESIDENT_DECIDES - Approved

[2025-12-12] D3 Progress: 21/23 decisions complete (91%)
