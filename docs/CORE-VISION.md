# Claude-Hybrid: Core Vision Document

**Project:** Claude-Hybrid
**Repository:** https://github.com/Enginex0/Claude-Hybrid
**Location:** /home/president/Claude-Hybrid
**Date:** 2025-12-07
**Visionary:** President

## The Dream

Build a unified hybrid framework that consolidates **BMAD Method** and **Claude-MPM** from scratch - not as a merge, but as a strategic rewrite with both concepts in mind, leveraging what works flawlessly from each.

---

## Source Frameworks Analysis

### BMAD Method - The Orchestration Virtuoso
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Repository** | https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD |
| **Stack** | Node.js, YAML, Markdown |
| **Scale** | 24,124 stars, 30 contributors |
| **Architecture** | 4-Phase Lifecycle (Analysis -> Planning -> Solutioning -> Implementation) |
| **Agents** | 19+ specialized agents across 4 modules (BMM, BMB, BMGD, CIS) |
| **Superpowers** | Step-file discipline, Party Mode, Scale-adaptive intelligence (L0-L4) |
| **Weakness** | No anti-hallucination gates, trusts LLM outputs |

### Claude-MPM - The Truth Sentinel
| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Repository** | https://github.com/bobmatnyc/claude-mpm |
| **Stack** | Python (18.6MB) |
| **Version** | 5.0.7 |
| **Architecture** | 4-Layer Defense (Schema -> Business Rules -> Execution Gates -> Runtime) |
| **Agents** | 47+ agents with JSON Schema validation |
| **Superpowers** | Proof-based validation, PM delegation enforcement, KuzuDB memory grounding, Hook system |
| **Weakness** | Less workflow orchestration, less phased methodology |

## The Synthesis Vision

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|                    CLAUDE-HYBRID                             |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  BMAD's Orchestration    +    MPM's Truth Enforcement       |
|  ---------------------       --------------------------     |
|  * 4-Phase Lifecycle         * 4-Layer Validation           |
|  * Step-file discipline      * Schema-enforced config       |
|  * Party Mode collaboration  * Hook-based gates             |
|  * Scale-adaptive (L0-L4)    * PM delegation enforcement    |
|  * Agent personas            * Memory grounding (KuzuDB)    |
|  * Workflow orchestration    * Proof-based execution        |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
                              |
                              v
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  RESULT: Grounded, Focused, Fast-to-Production Framework    |
|  * Context-managed workflows (200k limit respected)         |
|  * Zero hallucination through validation gates              |
|  * Phased development with proof requirements               |
|  * Millions of developers can trust the outputs             |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+

## Core Principles

1. **NOT a merge** - A strategic rewrite from scratch
2. **Both codebases as blueprints** - Reference, not copy
3. **Validation at every phase** - No phase proceeds without proof
4. **Context discipline** - Smart loading/unloading prevents bloat
5. **Workflow + Gates = Production velocity with quality**

---

## Proposed Phase-to-Layer Mapping

```
BMAD Phase              ->    MPM Validation Layer
------------------            ---------------------
Phase 1 (Analysis)      ->    Layer 1 (Schema Validation)
Phase 2 (Planning)      ->    Layer 2 (Business Rule Validation)
Phase 3 (Solutioning)   ->    Layer 3 (Execution Gates)
Phase 4 (Implementation)->    Layer 4 (Runtime Monitoring)
```

---

## Problems This Solves

1. **Claude's 200k context window** - Smart context management
2. **LLM hallucinations** - Proof-based validation gates
3. **Context bloating** - Disciplined loading/unloading
4. **Unfocused execution** - Phased workflow structure
5. **Slow production velocity** - Streamlined orchestration

---

## Target Audience

- Solo developers seeking production velocity
- Teams wanting structured AI-assisted development
- Enterprises requiring proof-based, auditable AI outputs
- Open source community building the future of AI development
