# Claude-Hybrid Progress Log

## Session 1 - 2025-12-07

### Vision Capture Session

**Participants:** President (Visionary), BMad Master (Facilitator)

**Key Decisions:**
1. Created new repository: https://github.com/Enginex0/Claude-Hybrid
2. Established core vision - hybrid framework consolidating BMAD + MPM
3. Confirmed approach: Rewrite from scratch with both concepts in mind (not merge)
4. Both codebases serve as blueprints/reference

**Frameworks Analyzed:**
- BMAD Method: 4-phase lifecycle, 19+ agents, Party Mode, scale-adaptive
- Claude-MPM: 4-layer validation, proof-based execution, hook system, memory grounding

**Proposed Architecture:**
- Phase-to-Layer mapping (BMAD phases -> MPM validation layers)
- Combined orchestration with truth enforcement

**Problems to Solve:**
1. 200k context window management
2. LLM hallucination prevention
3. Context bloating
4. Unfocused execution
5. Slow production velocity

**Next Steps:**
- Continue vision discussion
- Gather complete requirements from President
- Review prepared documentation
- Create detailed implementation plan
