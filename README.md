# Claude-Hybrid

> A unified hybrid framework consolidating BMAD Method's workflow orchestration with Claude-MPM's truth enforcement - built from scratch for grounded, focused, production-ready AI development.

## Vision

Claude-Hybrid combines the best of two worlds:

- **BMAD Method** - 4-phase lifecycle, step-file discipline, Party Mode, scale-adaptive intelligence
- **Claude-MPM** - 4-layer validation, proof-based execution, anti-hallucination gates, memory grounding

## Problems We Solve

- Claude's 200k context window limitations
- LLM hallucinations through proof-based validation
- Context bloating with disciplined loading/unloading
- Unfocused execution via phased workflow structure
- Slow production velocity through streamlined orchestration

## Status

**Currently:** Vision & Requirements Phase

See [docs/CORE-VISION.md](docs/CORE-VISION.md) for the complete vision document.
